This is my first iPhone app.
I'm still trying to work it out, so this is little more than HelloWorld.

ChristmasLights is an app that shows a tree with twinkling lights. It uses 4 rotating images to simulate it. There's also a second view. I've also implemented the Settings pane to change the name in the views. The strings are all in a strings file so they can be I18n'd.

I'm opening up my app here just to help me work it out. Do with it what you wish. The images are free to use for whatever.

Enjoy!
